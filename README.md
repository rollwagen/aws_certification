### Question Topics

Obviously I want to be really careful here re. NDA. What I will do is give a list of things I think you should know - without revealing anything about question content.

* Be really familiar with all the DNS Record types, and when and where you can use them. APEX vs NONAPEX.
* Be really familiar with all of the R53 routing types ... failover, weighted, geolocation
* CloudFront Security - private, public, signed URL/Cookie, OAI, restricting direct S3 Access
* Pre-signed URLs with S3 ... know them INSIDE OUT (REALLY... EVERYTHING)
* Encryption at rest options for all storage platforms within AWS
* For the above, which can be only enabled at creation and what can be adjusted afterwards.
* EFS Architecture, availability and latency
* Logging .. Know the format of VPC flow logs,Cloudtrail, S3 Logs, CloudFront and ALB Logs
* Re. the above - know what is contained in each, network, metadata, contents, Layer 7 stuff be able to understand flow logs, interpret them.
* Understand how having NACL and SG in place at the same time can influence what's shown in logs.
* Diagnose why an EC2 instance isn't reachable - IP, Routing, Security
* HA using ASG - how many AZ/Subnets and how many instances, what Desired, Max and Min values to use.
* Spot Fleets - features, architectures and how they work with on-demand instances
* VPC restricted S3 Buckets - how, what endpoints, how to secure, policies - which and where
* Restricting bucket to an endpoint
* Configuring routing for gateway endpoints
* How to restrict or allow a bucket to an entire ORG.
* Protecting buckets .. objects and buckets from deletion
* How to diagnose and fix a failed service on EC2
* Developer environments, ensuring identical environments, how to allow start by developers and how to orchestrate termination.
* CloudFormation template structure
* Cross Stack References vs Nested
* EBS Storage performance and how to improve
* EFS Storage performance and how to improve
* Be able to diagnose why EC2 storage performance is slow on instance store, EBS or EFS and how to fix
* Understand the Architecture, HA and Migration for elastic search
* Templates which work in a region are now failing, why - understand what is limited to regions in a CFN template and how to change templates to be portable.

* S3 Bucket Features - versioning, default encryption, lifecycle policies, Storage classes - know these all REALLY REALLY well.
* Automated reaction to ALB errors and lambda errors
* RTO and RPO ... on various AWS services
* For any given IAM Policy, be able to interpret and answer which of the answers is true or false.
