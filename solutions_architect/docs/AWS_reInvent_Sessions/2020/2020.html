When questions aren't answered by existing BI dashboards, users rely on thinly staffed BI teams to get answers, which typically takes days or weeks. With QuickSight Q, which uses natural language processing and semantic data understanding techniques, users can simply type their question (e.g., 'What is the year-over-year sales trend?') and get an answer in seconds. It extracts business terminology and intent, retrieves the corresponding data, and returns answers in the form of a number, chart, or table. Q makes it easy to get answers instantly, while freeing BI teams to focus on their core projects. This session introduces Q and demonstrates how to use it.</p>

</p>
<p class='d'>Software delivery can seem simple at first. Step 1: Build code. Step 2: Deploy application. Step 3: The end. Complexity often sneaks into our processes uninvited, disguised as scale, testing, auditing, sharing, etc. Delightfully simple workflows can quickly balloon into complex pipelines that require operators to see around every corner and, in many cases, are directly at odds with the declarative infrastructure processes operators love to build. In this session, Netflix and AWS discuss their collaboration on Spinnaker's next-gen vision for transitioning from an imperative mix of pipelines and stages to a more declarative description of end goals and bring the 'delightful' back to 'delivery.'</p>

<p class='d'>Full Title: Code-to-cloud visibility with observability &amp; pipeline analytics (sponsored by Splunk)<BR/><BR/>In the DevOps days, we talked about communication silos, where gated communications between teams didn't support the desired application velocity. Now that tech-enabled enterprises have discovered how to release code faster, they've inadvertently introduced new problems with bugs, vulnerabilities, and stack visibility problems. Faster software development lifecycles (SDLCs) have made supporting and securing applications more difficult. But the good news is that data can bridge the gap. In this session, hear how tech-enabled enterprises are leveraging tool-chain telemetry to break down data silos and create true visibility across the entire SDLC. Learn how the power of code-to-cloud visibility is that it helps teams keep up with release velocity and build better and more secure applications.
