</p>
<p class='d'>While the rationale for adopting a microservices architecture is well-understood, selecting the right size and scope of your microservices can be challenging—especially in SaaS environments. SaaS microservices must consider your multi-tenant isolation boundaries, your data partitioning requirements, your multi-tenant scaling profile, and your tiering strategy. These services must also be implemented in a model that abstracts away multi-tenant details and accelerates development. In this session, we look at a range of multi-tenant considerations that will directly affect your approach to identifying and implementing services that align with the scale, isolation, cost, and agility profile of your SaaS environment.</p>

<p class='d'>Yes, technologies like containers and Kubernetes can help make your software delivery processes easier and faster. However, these new deployment tools and orchestration methods are very different from a traditional environment in terms of management and monitoring. How should you architect your container so that it works the way that you want—and need—it to? Through the live examples provided in this session, you learn best practices for ensuring the efficiency and quality of the next application that you migrate to AWS. This presentation is brought to you by New Relic, an APN Partner.</p>

<p class='d'>Containerized applications, especially those using modern micro-service architectural patterns, are often robust to interruption and unexpected termination of individual containers. For this reason, containerized applications are a good fit for EC2 Spot and Fargate Spot. With minimal modifications, many containerized applications can run some or even all of their containers as-is on Spot at substantially lower cost. In this session we discuss the design decisions and best practices for utilizing EC2 Spot and Fargate Spot with modern containerized applications.</p>

</p>
<p class='d'>Getting started with containerized application development often requires you to first provision the infrastructure that will be used to run your containers, what we call "infrastructure-first" development. As serverless technologies such as AWS Fargate become more popular, the need to provision infrastructure often goes away entirely, allowing customers to focus on their applications first. In this session, we discuss how a new concept in Amazon ECS called Capacity Providers enables application-first design and development of containerized applications, whether on Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate.</p>

<p class='d'>Most business-critical applications rely on databases. Whether you have a new serverless cloud application, a database that is using Amazon RDS, or a high-transaction application using SAP HANA over hybrid cloud architecture, these databases need to be backed up, protected, and quickly recovered. Legacy backup solutions that were built for on-premises environments don't quite cut it for today's cloud workloads, while cloud snapshots can quickly become a burden to manage. Learn how to automate the backup of your cloud databases and provide fast and reliable recovery options when needed using Cohesity's modern data management software. This presentation is brought to you by Cohesity, an APN Partner.</p>

<p class='d'>Failures are inevitable. Regardless of the engineering efforts put into building resilient systems and handling edge cases, sometimes a case beyond our reach turns a benign failure into a catastrophic one. Therefore, we should test and continuously improve our system's resilience to failures to minimize impact on a user's experience. Chaos engineering is one of the best ways to achieve that. In this session, you learn how Amazon Prime Video has implemented chaos engineering into its regular testing methods, helping it achieve increased resiliency.</p>

<p class='d'>Tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, plane crashes, bombings, terrorist attacks - deadly disasters happen very frequently. Social media platforms such as Twitter have emerged as an effective tool for broadcasting messages worldwide during disaster events. However, with millions of messages posted through these services during such events, it has become very difficult to find useful information. Tweet hashtags or keywords have the potential to improve the search for information, but unfortunately, there is a large number of disaster-related tweets that do not have any user-provided hashtags or they are not useful for disaster response. In this talk, Cornelia Caragea shares how deep learning models can automatically extract useful information in the form of hashtags or keywords that can help emergency response organizations to become more situationally aware during and following a disaster.</p>

<p class='d'>Deepfakes or AI-generated images have captured the public imagination with examples of image and video manipulation that was the purview of artists and studios until recently. Deepfakes along with their audio analog -- Audiofakes -- have the potential to create an 'information disorder' where there can be an inability to show something real as real and an ability to show something fake as real. In this talk, I will be contextualizing multimedia fakes in the broader misinformation landscape and exploring some state-of-the-art solutions for detecting Deepfakes and Audiofakes.</p>

We will demonstrate how to use IAM Access Analyzer to identify resource policies that don't comply with your organization's security requirements and then proactively protect resources from unintended access. Learn how Millennium Management uses IAM Access Analyzer across their company to analyze policies associated with Amazon S3 buckets, AWS KMS keys, and more.</p>

</p>
<p class='d'>The Amazon EC2 instance metadata service (IMDS) provides a rich set of relevant data to software on that instance. The IMDS ability to perform introspection about the runtime environment, as well as to pass parameters and code through user data, greatly simplifies software development and deployment. At the same time, an instance's metadata includes private information, such as AWS credentials, that should be limited to the software or humans that need access. In this session, we take a close look at the IMDS and mechanisms for protecting it from unintended access, including new capabilities provided by the recently launched IMDS version.</p>

</p>
<p class='d'>Many developers have become familiar with building microservices on traditional compute offerings such as virtual machines and containers, but what about serverless? The 'functions as a service' model behind AWS Lambda presents a number of unique differences while still providing many benefits that make it a strong fit for microservices-based architectures. In this session, we talk about mapping microservices-based architectures to Lambda's event model. You learn how to think about the bounds of functions and their alignment to the services represented. We then cover patterns that enable rapid development and easier testing. Walk away ready to build your next microservice with AWS Lambda.</p>

<p class='d'>This presentation was recorded prior to re:Invent. The twelve-factor application model is composed of twelve best practices for building modern, cloud-native applications. With guidance on factors like configuration, deployment, runtime, and multiple-service communication, the twelve-factor model prescribes practices that apply to everything from web applications to APIs and data-processing applications. Although serverless computing and AWS Lambda have changed application development, the twelve-factor methodology remains relevant and applicable in a serverless world. In this talk, we apply the twelve-factor model to serverless application development with Lambda and Amazon API Gateway, and we demonstrate how these services enable you to create scalable, well-built, low-administration applications.</p>

<p class='d'>APIs have become the norm for allowing applications to communicate with each other. On AWS, customers turn to Amazon API Gateway to build HTTP, REST, or WebSocket APIs, providing communication endpoints between services and clients. However, API Gateway can do much more. In this session, we demo setting up a REST API using API Gateway. We walk though configuring a simple Lambda-based backend and adding on capabilities around data modeling and validation, custom responses, and functionless integration with backend services. Learn about some of the advanced functionality that can be done at the API level before it ever hits your backend service.</p>

<p class='d'>Overloading a software system occurs more often than expected, and the effects are difficult to deal with, including real-time web services halting and asynchronous systems building up backlogs. In this talk, we cover what AWS does to build reliable and resilient services, including avoiding modes and overload, performing bounded work, throttling at multiple layers, guarding concurrency, sending idempotent requests, applying backpressure and fairness in queueing, and performing shuffle sharding. We also discuss how separating concerns through service-oriented architectures helps reduce blast radius. As we explore these patterns, we discuss how they're embedded into the DNA of the AWS services that you use to build and operate serverless applications that are resilient to failure. We also discuss a number of AWS services, including AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, AWS WAF, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS X-Ray.</p>

<p class='d'>A Department of Defense (DoD) organization had unique challenges developing and deploying applications in multiple security domains (running workloads across AWS commercial regions, AWS Secret Region, and Commercial Cloud Services), which is a common pattern in the DoD. In this session, learn how the organization restructured its technical team—comprising military service members, government employees, and contractors—to adopt the DevOps software development approach, and how it has embraced containerization and Kubernetes, as well as AWS native automation capabilities and partner tools. We also discuss how these methods and tool sets have acted as a pathfinder for adoption by the broader community.</p>

<p class='d'>The BlueDot Water Observatory is an Earth-observation-based solution that provides reliable and timely information about surface water levels across the globe. Cost-effective yet reliable solutions for monitoring water resources are needed, as ground-based monitoring networks are often too costly and, in some cases, also unreliable. Sinergise shows how using global satellite imagery available on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) through the AWS Public Dataset Program, combined with an efficient use of services including AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon CloudWatch, you can carry out a global-scale project cheaper than previously possible.</p>
