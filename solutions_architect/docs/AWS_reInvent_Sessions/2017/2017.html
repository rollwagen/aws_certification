</p>
<p class='d'>Banks aren't known to share data and collaborate with one another. But that is exactly what the Mid-Sized Bank Coalition of America (MBCA) is doing to fight digital financial crime—and protect national security. Using the AWS Cloud, the MBCA developed a shared data analytics utility that processes terabytes of non-competitive customer account, transaction, and government risk data. The intelligence produced from the data helps banks increase the efficiency of their operations, cut labor and operating costs, and reduce false positive volumes. The collective intelligence also allows greater enforcement of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations by helping members detect internal risks—and identify the challenges to detecting these risks in the first place. This session demonstrates how the AWS Cloud supports the MBCA to deliver advanced data analytics, provide consistent operating models across financial institutions, reduce costs, and strengthen national security.

</p>
<p class='d'>Historically, silos of data, analytics, and processes across functions, stages of development, and geography created a barrier to R&amp;D efficiency. Gathering the right data necessary for decision-making was challenging due to issues of accessibility, trust, and timeliness. In this session, learn how Takeda is undergoing a transformation in R&amp;D to increase the speed-to-market of high-impact therapies to improve patient lives. The Data and Analytics Hub was built, with Deloitte, to address these issues and support the efficient generation of data insights for functions such as clinical operations, clinical development, medical affairs, portfolio management, and R&amp;D finance. In the AWS hosted data lake, this data is processed, integrated, and made available to business end users through data visualization interfaces, and to data scientists through direct connectivity. Learn how Takeda has achieved significant time reductions—from weeks to minutes—to gather and provision data that has the potential to reduce cycle times in drug development. The hub also enables more efficient operations and alignment to achieve product goals through cross functional team accountability and collaboration due to the ability to access the same cross domain data.

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/abd210-deloitte-amtrak-case-study"><img src="slideshare.png"></a>
</p>
<p class='d'>As the nation's only high-speed intercity passenger rail provider, Amtrak needs to know critical information to run their business such as: Who's onboard any train at any time? How are booking and revenue trending? Amtrak was faced with unpredictable and often slow response times from existing databases, ranging from seconds to hours; existing booking and revenue dashboards were spreadsheet-based and manual; multiple copies of data were stored in different repositories, lacking integration and consistency; and operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs were relatively high. Join us as we demonstrate how Deloitte and Amtrak successfully went live with a cloud-native operational database and analytical datamart for near-real-time reporting in under six months. We highlight the specific challenges and the modernization of architecture on an AWS native Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution. The solution includes cloud-native components such as AWS Lambda for microservices, Amazon Kinesis and AWS Data Pipeline for moving data, Amazon S3 for storage, Amazon DynamoDB for a managed NoSQL database service, and Amazon Redshift for near-real time reports and dashboards. Deloitte's solution enabled “at scale” processing of 1 million transactions/day and up to 2K transactions/minute. It provided flexibility and scalability, largely eliminate the need for system management, and dramatically reduce operating costs. Moreover, it laid the groundwork for decommissioning legacy systems, anticipated to save at least $1M over 3 years. Session sponsored by Deloitte</p>

<p class='d'>Petabyte scale archives of satellites, planes, and drones imagery continue to grow exponentially. They mostly exist as semi-structured data, but they are only valuable when accessed and processed by a wide range of products for both visualization and analysis. This session provides an overview of how ArcGIS indexes and structures data so that any part of it can be quickly accessed, processed, and analyzed by reading only the minimum amount of data needed for the task. In this session, we share best practices for structuring and compressing massive datasets in Amazon S3, so it can be analyzed efficiently. We also review a number of different image formats, including GeoTIFF (used for the Public Datasets on AWS program, Landsat on AWS), cloud optimized GeoTIFF, MRF, and CRF as well as different compression approaches to show the effect on processing performance. Finally, we provide examples of how this technology has been used to help image processing and analysis for the response to Hurricane Harvey.</p>

<p class='d'>Last year, Capital One joined Alexa on stage to talk about their experience building their successful Alexa skill. Since that time, many lessons have been learned through customer feedback and new enhancements to the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) such as the skills beta testing tool and the Alexa skill builder. How can you evolve your Alexa skill with more meaningful data sets outside of the existing intents? As the Alexa Skills Kit has grown its built-in library, what does it mean for your skill to support both ordinal (list) and numerical values? How can you handle new specifications without requiring wholesale code changes? Capital One has tackled all of these issues as well as embracing additional programming languages like TypeScript to ensure that response structures are validated against all schemas. With the arrival of multimodal devices such as the Echo Show, the opportunity for seamless customer interaction models across voice and visual has also arrived (big fonts, touch, video). Your customers can now transition back and forth between using their voice and their hands while engaging with your skill. Come learn direct from Capital One on the best way of providing extra contextual information using the new Alexa Skills Kit display directives but in more convenient ways to get things done.</p>

<p class='d'>When engineering teams take on a new project, they often optimize for performance, availability, or fault tolerance. More experienced teams can optimize for these variables simultaneously. Netflix adds an additional variable: feature velocity. Most companies try to optimize for feature velocity through process improvements and engineering hierarchy, but Netflix optimizes for feature velocity through explicit architectural decisions. Mental models of approaching availability help us understand the tension between these engineering variables. For example, understanding the distinction between accidental complexity and essential complexity can help you decide whether to invest engineering effort into simplifying your stack or expanding the surface area of functional output. The Chaos team and the Traffic team interact with other teams at Netflix under an assumption of Essential Complexity. Incident remediation, approaches to automation, and diversity of engineering can all be understood through the perspective of these mental models. With insight and diligence, these models can be applied to improve availability over time and drift into success.</p>

<p class='d'>This talk includes a story and a recipe. The story is about a nerd who bought his first motorbike, got a license for it, and started hacking to make it interact and talk, all in two months. The recipe is a technical one that explains how to use Amazon Lex and Amazon Lambda to quickly prototype and deploy a serverless chatbot connected with an embedded device in order to realize an Internet of Things (IoT) application. We discuss how you can integrate your IoT application with Amazon Lex using AWS Lambda and the Amazon API Gateway, how to exchange session data to have a contextual conversation, and how to provide a successful bot experience. Expect to leave this session knowing how to build, deploy, and publish a bot, and how to attach it to an IoT device—with the potential to bringing to life any object that surrounds you.</p>

</p>
<p class='d'>As serverless architectures become more popular, customers need a framework of patterns to help them identify how they can leverage AWS to deploy their workloads without managing servers or operating systems. This session describes reusable serverless patterns while considering costs. For each pattern, we provide operational and security best practices and discuss potential pitfalls and nuances. We also discuss the considerations for moving an existing server-based workload to a serverless architecture. The patterns use services like AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Kinesis Streams, Amazon Kinesis Analytics, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, AWS Step Functions, AWS Config, AWS X-Ray, and Amazon Athena. This session can help you recognize candidates for serverless architectures in your own organizations and understand areas of potential savings and increased agility. What's new in 2017: using X-Ray in Lambda for tracing and operational insight; a pattern on high performance computing (HPC) using Lambda at scale; how a query can be achieved using Athena; Step Functions as a way to handle orchestration for both the Automation and Batch patterns; a pattern for Security Automation using AWS Config rules to detect and automatically remediate violations of security standards; how to validate API parameters in API Gateway to protect your API back-ends; and a solid focus on CI/CD development pipelines for serverless, which includes testing, deploying, and versioning (SAM tools).</p>

</p>
<p class='d'>4K video has resulted in a huge uptick in resource requirements, which is difficult to scale in a traditional environment. The cloud is perfect to handle problems of this scale. However, many unanswered questions remain around best practices and suitable architectures for dealing with massive, high-quality assets. We define problem cases and discuss practical architectural patterns to handle these challenges by using AWS services such as Amazon EC2 (graphical instances), Amazon EMR, Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration, Amazon Glacier, AWS Snowball, and magnetic Amazon EBS volumes. The best practices we discuss can also help architects and engineers dealing with non-video data. Also, Amazon Studios presents how, powered by AWS, they solved many of these problems and can create, manage, and distribute Emmy and Oscar Award-winning content.</p>

<p class='d'>AWS Metering provides customers with detailed usage information (down to a specific Amazon EC2 instance or Amazon S3 bucket used in a single hour), enabling them to gain deep insights into their utilization of cloud resources. However, this level of transparency is not available across most customers' traditional IT infrastructure, making it difficult to understand what resources are being used, when, and by whom. Join us in this session to learn how to meter, measure, and understand your usage from AWS, on-premises data centers, containers, serverless compute, even other clouds across your IT infrastructure. We show you how to meter your non-AWS resources to make smarter decisions about your business and investment in the cloud.</p>

<p class='d'>When customers across the globe place orders on Amazon.com, those orders are processed through many different backend systems, including Herd, a workflow-orchestration engine developed by the Amazon eCommerce Foundation team. A mission-critical system used by more than 300 Amazon engineering teams, Herd executes over four billion workflows every day. Beginning in 2013, Herd's workflow traffic was doubling year-over-year, and scaling its then dozens of horizontally-partitioned Oracle databases was becoming a nightmare, and this number kept increasing. To support Herd's increasing scaling needs, and to provide a better customer experience, the Herd team had to re-architect its storage system and move its primary data storage from Oracle to Amazon DynamoDB. In this session, we discuss how we moved from Oracle to Amazon DynamoDB, walk through the biggest challenges we faced and how we overcame them, and share the lessons we learned along the way.</p>

<p class='d'>SaaS presents developers with a unique blend of architectural challenges. While the concepts of multi-tenancy are straightforward, the reality of making all the moving parts work together can be daunting. In this session, we move beyond the conceptual bits of SaaS and look under the hood of an SaaS application. Our goal is to examine the fundamentals of identity, data partitioning, and tenant isolation through the lens of a working solution and to highlight the challenges and strategies associated with building a next generation SaaS application on AWS. We look at the full lifecycle of registering new tenants, applying security policies to prevent cross-tenant access, and leveraging tenant profiles to effectively distribute and partition tenant data. We intend to connect many of the conceptual dots of an SaaS implementation, highlighting the tradeoffs and considerations that can shape your approach to SaaS architecture.</p>

Over the past eleven years EC2 has evolved to provide an extensive selection of compute resources to customers including specialized resources such as NVMe SSDs, GPUs, and FPGAs. Under the hood, the servers used to host EC2 instances have transformed from off the shelf designs running virtualization software on the host CPUs to purpose built servers with AWS network and storage components implemented in hardware. Now we are happy to announce a new category of EC2 instances: Amazon EC2 Bare Metal Instances. These instances provide customers access to the physical compute resources of the host processors along with the security, scale, and services of EC2.

<p class='d'>Netflix runs hundreds of multivariate A/B tests a year, many of which help personalize the experience in the UI. This causes an exponential growth in the number of user experiences served to members, with each unique experience resulting in a unique JS/CSS bundle. Pre-publishing millions of permutations to the CDN for each build of each UI simply does not work at Netflix scale. In this session, we discuss how we built, designed, and scaled a brand new Node.js service, Codex. Its sole responsibility is to build personalized JS/CSS bundles on the fly for members as they move through the Netflix user experience. We've learned a ton about building a horizontally scalable Node.js microservice using core AWS services.

<p class='d'>AWS architecture for Careem, a fast-growing car-booking service in the broader Middle East, has quickly evolved to support over six million users in eleven countries. Careem also operates in areas with weak GPS signals and unique traffic patterns, resulting in the poor user experience of long driver match times and rider wait times. Careem was storing driver location data in MySQL, but their high volume of concurrent calls and lack of geospatial support in MySQL 5.6 resulted in continuous deadlocks and performance issues. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis helped meet their need for in-memory storage service with advanced data structures. ElastiCache for Redis accelerated their car booking application and reduced ride matching times from several minutes to milliseconds.

<p class='d'>The IARPA Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (MICrONS) program is a research endeavor created to improve neurally-plausible machine-learning algorithms by understanding data representations and learning rules used by the brain through structurally and functionally interrogating a cubic millimeter of mammalian neocortex. This effort requires efficiently storing, visualizing, and processing petabytes of neuroimaging data. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) has developed an open-source, highly available service to manage these data, called the Boss. The Boss uses AWS to provide a cloud-native spatial database with an innovative storage hierarchy and auto-scaling capability to balance cost and performance. This system extensively uses serverless components to meet both scalability and cost requirements. In this session, we provide an overview of the Boss, and we focus on how the APL used Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and AWS Step Functions for several high-throughput components of the system. We discuss both the challenges and successes with serverless technologies.</p>

<p class='d'>Cisco's video solutions were historically designed for on-premises dedicated hardware deployments. Typically, major releases occurred annually or bi-annually. The release process lacked the ability to absorb frequent changes and adapt to rapid market trends. This session looks into how Cisco's IVP Solution team evolved a production system from its monolithic design into a microservices platform, leveraging cloud services, automated deployments, and delivery pipelines. Through this transition the team adopted a biweekly deployment cadence. This ultimately enabled a fast-paced migration to an AWS environment, using AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service.</p>

<p class='d'>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are critical real-time software applications used to manage nearly any form of upstream, midstream, and downstream processes in the energy industry. Traditionally, these technologies have been deployed on premises and managed separately from core IT, to ensure security, availability and consistent performance.   As energy and utility companies expand geographically, and the number and types of sensors in each location grow, disparate and growing data streams are becoming increasingly complex and challenging to manage. It is estimated that up to 95% of valuable device and sensor information is left stranded in the field, information that could prove valuable to machine learning, predictive analytics, and process optimization.    In this session, energy and utility customers will learn how easy it is to implement IIoT on AWS, so they can easily extract value from additional devices and sensors, and innovate faster. We will dive into a reference architecture for accessing current mission critical SCADA data as well as previously stranded data into AWS using Kinesis and DynamoDB, ultimately enabling customers to reduce downtime, increase efficiencies, improve reliability, and gain more business insights through connected data.</p>

<p class='d'>For years, Riot Games deployed to their own private data centers across the globe to meet the growing demands of their game, League of Legends. The last seven years saw explosive growth in new data centers worldwide, along with a great deal of technical debt. This is Riot Games' story of how they overcame their technical debt by taking the League of Legends platform into the AWS Cloud. AWS services gave Riot Games the infrastructure agility they were lacking within their data centers and empowered them to focus more on new player features and less on legacy infrastructure. In this session, you learn why and how Riot Games migrated their existing platform to the AWS Cloud and the advantages gained by the move using services such as Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing (with Application Load Balancers), Amazon EBS, and Auto Scaling. Riot Games also shares how they created new automation toolsets to enable the existing tools and replace a few legacy ones.</p>

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/gam305automating-mother-nature"><img src="slideshare.png"></a>
</p>
<p class='d'>Given the complexity and scale of contemporary games, it's been a dream of game creators to algorithmically generate game content. Nexon wanted to create a large-scale, open-world MMORPG called Durango, where algorithmic generation is desperately needed to minimize development costs and maintain game longevity. In-game objects such as trees and plants are placed based on complex rules, with the intention of mimicking the realistic ecosystem that evolves continuously. However, a large amount of computation and a careful orchestration of various computing resources are required due to the immense size of the in-game lands. Nexon achieved this goal by leveraging AWS services to take advantage of massive parallelism supported by the infrastructure. In this talk, Nexon discusses the architecture they settled on for algorithmic generation of game content in a large scale, and the AWS services involved such as Amazon SQS and Amazon ECS with automatic scaling and spot instances.</p>

It is a very serious challenge to business because attackers go after business critical or highly confidential data. Data exfiltration can be done manually by a person, or automated using scripts. Attack sophistication increases by the day. Signature-based techniques to defend against attacks are limited and cannot protect against zero-day attacks. To counter this, we use machine learning (ML) techniques. ML is effective at solving many problems in computer vision, robotics, etc., and is increasingly used in security.

<p class='d'>Identity is a foundational element of SaaS design, and getting it right can be challenging. You need a strategy that allows you to connect users to tenants, roles, and policies in a seamless model that doesn't handcuff developers. Fortunately, identity providers and OpenID Connect give us a model that equips SaaS providers with the tools they need to address all the moving parts of SaaS identity. In this session, we dive into the details of how you can use these solutions to build a robust identity solution—a solution that covers binding identities to tenants, supports tenant and system roles, and isolates tenant access. The goal here is to provide a concrete example of how to orchestrate all of these elements of the SaaS identity model on AWS.</p>

<p class='d'>At Netflix, we use machine learning (ML) algorithms extensively to recommend relevant titles to our 100+ million members based on their tastes. Everything on the member home page is an evidence-driven, A/B-tested experience that we roll out backed by ML models. These models are trained using Meson, our workflow orchestration system. Meson distinguishes itself from other workflow engines by handling more sophisticated execution graphs, such as loops and parameterized fan-outs. Meson can schedule Spark jobs, Docker containers, bash scripts, gists of Scala code, and more. Meson also provides a rich visual interface for monitoring active workflows and inspecting execution logs. It has a powerful Scala DSL for authoring workflows as well as the REST API. In this session, we focus on how Meson trains recommendation ML models in production, and how we have re-architected it to scale up for a growing need of broad ETL applications within Netflix. As a driver for this change, we have had to evolve the persistence layer for Meson. We talk about how we migrated from Cassandra to Amazon RDS backed by Amazon Aurora.</p>

</p>
<p class='d'>In machine learning, training large models on massive amount of data usually improved results. Our customers report, however, that training such models and deploying them is either operationally prohibitive or outright impossible for them. Amazon AI Algorithms is designed to solve this problem. It is a collection of distributed streaming ML algorithms that scale to any amount of data. They are fast and efficient because they distribute across CPU/GPU machines and share a collective distributed state via a highly-optimized parameter server. They scale to an infinite amount of data because they operate in the streaming model. This means they require only one pass over the data and never increase their resources consumption, allowing training to be paused, resumed, and snapshotted and even for algorithms to consume kinesis streams directly providing an “always on” training mechanism.  They are production ready.  Trained models are automatically containerized and useable in production using Amazon SageMaker hosting. Finally, we provide a convenient SDK which allows scientists to create new algorithms which operate in this model and enjoy all the benefits above.  This talk will discuss our design choices and some of the internal working of the system. It will also describe the distributed streaming model and its numerous benefits to machine learning practitioners. We will show how to invoke large scale learning from Amazon SageMaker, or Amazon EMR, and host the solution. Time permits, we will show how to develop a new Algorithm using the SDK.   </p>

This session shows you how to implement a networking construct that AWS calls a transit VPC using the Cisco Cloud Services Router. This network topology simplifies network management and minimizes the number of connections that you need to set up and manage. Even better, it is implemented virtually and doesn't require physical network gear or a physical presence in a colocation transit hub. Come hear why customers are procuring this service through AWS Marketplace and how customers are using the transit VPC for private networking, shared connectivity, and cross-account AWS usage.</p>

<p class='d'>In some organizations, the theme of “can't we all just get along” accurately describes the relationship between DevOps and network security. DevOps operates at a rapid and dynamic pace, using the cloud to create and deploy. Security teams exercise industry best practices of policy change control to eliminate potential security holes. Inevitably, deployment challenges arise. The ideal solution is one where security becomes part of the DevOps fabric. In this session, Ivan Bojer, automation specialist, and Jaime Franklin, cloud architect, both of Palo Alto Networks, discuss and demonstrate how AWS customers can automate the deployment of the VM-Series next generation firewall to protect DevOps environments on AWS. The topics in this session are based on current customer examples. They include: “touchless” deployment of a fully configured firewall utilizing automation tools, such as AWS CloudFormation templates, Terraform, and Ansible; consuming AWS tags to execute commitless policy updates; using Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing to deliver scalability and resiliency. This session wraps up with a discussion of sample templates and scripts to get started and a video demonstration of a fully automated VM-Series deployment.

<p class='d'>You need a new approach to security for serverless applications. Classic approaches just don't make sense, because tools and process can only take you so far. You need a fresh look at what security means in these environments. Serverless applications let you focus on solving the problem at hand. Gone are most of the worries of traditional solutions. No more support code. No more building out infrastructure to deliver your application. This means you have to do less and get more in return. Classic operations fall by the wayside and you can scale your team in unprecedented ways. But what does this mean for security? No matter the design pattern, you're always responsible for your data, even if you're not running the underlying infrastructure. How do you make sure your data is safe and secure if you can't apply the usual set of security controls? In this session, we explore how serverless designs impact security. We look at how the right approach can modernize your security practice, streamline ops, and reduce your workload.

</p>
<p class='d'>Many enterprises choosing to adopt Office 365 for business productivity continue to use Amazon EC2 instances to run Microsoft workloads that require highly advanced functionality and customization. In addition, many enterprise deployments of Office 365 have requirements to manage and synchronize user profiles to Office 365, such as restricting user access and providing secure mobile access. They leverage AWS for these components. In this session, you learn how to architect a solution that benefits from the scalability and agility of AWS while maintaining an investment in Office 365 productivity. We discuss the Office 365 services most commonly deployed to AWS to meet these requirements and show how to connect AWS to Azure AD to ensure a globally consistent set of access policies.</p>
