<p class='d'>Learn how to develop voice-based serverless back ends for Alexa Voice Service (AVS) and Alexa devices using the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), which allows you to add new voice-based interactions to Alexa. We’ll code a new skill, implemented by a serverless backend leveraging AWS services such as Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. Often, your skill needs to authenticate your users and link them back to your backend systems and to persist state between user invocations. User authentication is performed by leveraging OAuth compatible identity systems. Running such a system on your back end requires undifferentiated heavy lifting or boilerplate code. We’ll leverage Login with Amazon as the identity provider instead, allowing you to focus on your application implementation and not on the low-level user management parts. At the end of this session, you’ll be able to develop your own Alexa skills and use Amazon and AWS services to minimize the required backend infrastructure. This session shows you how to deploy your Alexa skill code on a serverless infrastructure, leverage AWS Lambda, use Amazon Cognito and Login with Amazon to authenticate users, and leverage AWS DynamoDB as a fully managed NoSQL data store.</p>

<p class='d'>Over the last few years, we have seen a dramatic increase in the use of open source projects as the mainstay of architectures in both startups and enterprises. Many of our customers and partners also run their own open source programs and contribute key technologies to the industry as a whole (see DCS201). At AWS we engage with open source projects in a number of ways. We contribute bug fixes and enhancements to popular projects including our work with the Hadoop ecosystem (see BDM401), Chromium (see BAP305) and (obviously) Boto. We have our own standalone projects including the security library s2n (see NET405) and machine learning project MXnet (see MAC401). We also have services that make open source easier to use like ECS for Docker (see CON316), and RDS for MySQL and PostgreSQL (see DAT305). In this session you will learn about our existing open source work across AWS, and our next steps.</p>

<p class='d'>IT is evolving from a cost center to a source of continuous innovation for business. At the heart of this transition are modern, revenue-generating applications, based on dynamic architectures that constantly evolve to keep pace with end-customer demands. This dynamic application environment requires a new, comprehensive approach to traditional monitoring – one based on real-time, end-to-end visibility and analytics across the entire application lifecycle and stack, instead of monitoring by piecemeal. This presentation highlights practical advice on how developers and operators can leverage data and analytics to glean critical information about their modern applications. In this session, we will cover the types of data important for today’s modern applications. We’ll discuss visibility and analytics into data sources such as AWS services (e.g., Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, VPC Flow Logs, Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, etc.), development tool chain, and custom metrics, and describe how to use analytics to understand business performance and behaviors. We discuss a comprehensive approach to monitoring, troubleshooting, and customer usage insights, provide examples of effective data analytics to improve software quality, and describe an end-to-end customer use case that highlights how analytics applies to the modern app lifecycle and stack.</p>

</p><p class='s'>Shreekant Kishor Mandke - Software Development Manager, Amazon.com</p>
<p class='d'>In this session, we share how an Amazon.com team that owns a document management platform that manages billions of critical customer documents for Amazon.com migrated from a relational to a non-relational database. Initially, the service was built as an Oracle database. As it grew, the team discovered the limits of the relational model and decided to migrate to a non-relational database. They chose Amazon DynamoDB for its built-in resilience, scalability, and predictability. We provide a template that you can use to migrate from a relational data store to DynamoDB. We also provide details about the entire process: design patterns for moving from a SQL schema to a NoSQL schema; mechanisms used to transition from an ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) model to an eventually consistent model; migration alternatives considered; pitfalls in common migration strategies; and how to ensure service availability and consistency during migration.</p>

<p class='d'>The world is producing an ever increasing volume, velocity, and variety of big data. Consumers and businesses are demanding up-to-the-second (or even millisecond) analytics on their fast-moving data, in addition to classic batch processing. AWS delivers many technologies for solving big data problems. But what services should you use, why, when, and how? In this session, we simplify big data processing as a data bus comprising various stages: ingest, store, process, and visualize. Next, we discuss how to choose the right technology in each stage based on criteria such as data structure, query latency, cost, request rate, item size, data volume, durability, and so on. Finally, we provide reference architecture, design patterns, and best practices for assembling these technologies to solve your big data problems at the right cost.</p>

<p class='d'>Data science is a key discipline in a data-driven organization. Through analytics, data scientists can uncover previously unknown relationships in data to help an organization make better decisions. However, data science is often performed from local machines with limited resources and multiple datasets on a variety of databases. Moving to the cloud can help organizations provide scalable compute and storage resources to data scientists, while freeing them from the burden of setting up and managing infrastructure.</p>

<p class='d'>Amazon S3 is the central data hub for Netflix's big data ecosystem. We currently have over 1.5 billion objects and 60+ PB of data stored in S3. As we ingest, transform, transport, and visualize data, we find this data naturally weaving in and out of S3. Amazon S3 provides us the flexibility to use an interoperable set of big data processing tools like Spark, Presto, Hive, and Pig. It serves as the hub for transporting data to additional data stores / engines like Teradata, Redshift, and Druid, as well as exporting data to reporting tools like Microstrategy and Tableau. Over time, we have built an ecosystem of services and tools to manage our data on S3. We have a federated metadata catalog service that keeps track of all our data. We have a set of data lifecycle management tools that expire data based on business rules and compliance. We also have a portal that allows users to see the cost and size of their data footprint. In this talk, we’ll dive into these major uses of S3, as well as many smaller cases, where S3 smoothly addresses an important data infrastructure need. We will also provide solutions and methodologies on how you can build your own S3 big data hub.</p>

<p class='d'>At Librato, a Solarwinds company, we run hundreds of Cassandra instances across multiple rings and use it as our primary data store. In the past year, we embarked on a process to upgrade our fleet of Cassandra Amazon EC2 instances from instance store to instances using Amazon EBS and attached elastic network interfaces (ENIs). We find running Cassandra on EBS gives us the flexibility to choose the best instances for the best performance of our workload while saving us significant costs on infrastructure. In this session, we discuss how Librato operates Cassandra on EBS. Topics include how we chose the right instance for our workload, use detached EBS volumes and ENI mobility to reduce MTTR, use mixed EBS storage types for the best cost/performance tradeoff, debug performance issues, and continuously monitor Cassandra to get the most from AWS. We also look at performance tradeoffs made in the implementation of storage engines of large data systems like Cassandra.</p>

<p class='d'>Each of the four distinct compute services available from AWS bring unique advantages to your application's design: Amazon EC2, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda. However, your security responsibilities change with each of these services. For example, with Amazon EC2 and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you need a plan to lock down the operating system, your applications, and your data. Containers running in Amazon ECS provides additional flexibility and mobility but also introduces new challenges as most security techniques were not designed with containers in mind. AWS Lambda requires a completely new approach to security design at the function level.</p>

Docker containers offer a way to develop and test your application in the same environment in which it runs in production. You can use tools such as the ECS CLI and Docker Compose for local testing of applications; Jenkins and AWS CodePipeline for building and workflow orchestration; Amazon EC2 Container Registry to store your container images; and Amazon EC2 Container Service to manage and scale containers. In this session, you will learn how to build containers into your development workflow and orchestrate container deployments using Amazon ECS. You will hear how Okta runs 30,000 tests per developer commit and releases 10,000 new lines of code each week to production with a CI system based on 100% AWS services. We'll also discuss how Okta uses ECS for parallelized testing in CI and for production microservices in a multi-region, always on cloud service.</p>

We are witnessing an unprecedented growth in the amount of data collected, in many different shapes and forms. Storage, management, and analysis of this data requires database services that scale and perform in ways not possible before. AWS offers a collection of such database and other data services like Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon EMR to process, store, manage, and analyze data. In this session, we provide an overview of AWS database services and discuss how our customers are using these services today.</p>

<p class='d'>It can help you do much more. You can use DMS to consolidate multiple databases into a single database or split a single database into multiple databases. You can also use DMS for data distribution to multiple systems. For both of these use cases your source database can be outside of AWS (on premises) or in AWS (EC2 or RDS). DMS can also be used for near real-time replication of data. Replication can be done to one or more targets within AWS, in the same region or across regions. You can also replicate data from databases within AWS to databases outside of AWS. In this session we will discuss all these usage patterns and help you try them out yourselves.</p>

</p><p class='s'>Amit Sharma - Partner Solutions Architect, Amazon Web Services &amp; KD Singh - Partner Solution Architect, Amazon Web Services &amp; Scott Ward - Solutions Architect, Amazon Web Services</p>
<p class='d'>Easy scalability is a powerful feature of Amazon Aurora. Scalability in its actual definition refers to being able to get larger or smaller depending on the need. Amazon Aurora allows you to easily achieve this by scaling the database instance up or down and adding or removing read replicas. Scaling across regions brings additional resilience to your architectures and could boost your application performance due to geographic proximity. You can perform all of these scaling operations through the Aurora console. You can also automate instance and read scaling using lambda function or scripts based on the usage pattern you define. You can extend the automation by feeding your database usage data from Aurora enhanced monitoring into Machine Learning to provide more sophisticated predictive patterns to drive your automation. In this session we will do a deep dive into how scalability works in Aurora and how to make the best use of it to reduce your cost, increase application performance and architect resilient applications.</p>

<p class='d'>Every enterprise knows by now that it can save money by simply lifting and shifting workloads to the cloud, but many are missing the larger opportunity to also make money by moving. While quick costs savings are good for the bottom line, they do little to move the top line numbers. To achieve both savings and earnings, corporate thinking about technologies must change in order to enable faster processes leveraged enterprise-wide. In this session we will explore multiple customer success stories where the customers have evolved from leveraging basic compute and storage products (EC2 and S3) to integrating new services into operations by leveraging Lambda, DynamoDB, CodeDeploy, etc. Once this is achieved, enterprises are enabled to manage and deploy code rapidly in a programmatic and elastic secure network, ensuring governance and security standards across the globe. We will look at the migration process trusted by hundreds of clients as well as how to cope with the process and people components that are so important to enable agility, while focusing heavily on the technology. The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) and 2nd Watch story will dive deep into the technology that allows TCCC to manage hundreds of AWS Accounts, hundreds of workloads, thousands of instances, and hundreds of business partners around the globe.

<p class='d'>After launching several thousand EC2 instances in the cloud, we've learned that the key to running an IT fleet successfully on AWS is enforcing operational and economic discipline. As AWS service consumption grows, operational costs and overhead shouldn't grow linearly. Instead, IT should encourage new tenants that migrate from data centers to AWS to slowly shift toward a self-service delivery model and adopt the DevOps operations model. Creating and offering an AWS Cloud operations service catalog enables organizations to efficiently take full advantage of AWS' flexibility and modularity. T-Mobile, whose journey to AWS Cloud management started more than 2 years ago, uses a service catalog to enforce operational discipline in the Cloud. Their catalog is custom crafted for each Cloud-based IT workload.

<p class='d'>Modern financial services organizations rely heavily on technology and automated systems to run business-as-usual. However, if this technology were interrupted by natural disasters or other events, there could be a devastating impact on investors and market participants, and in turn your reputational brand. In this session, we provide a step-by-step disaster recovery solution employed by a major exchange. This solution leverages Amazon EC2 Container Service to provide Docker containers, Weave Net to support a multicast overlay network that enables high volume multicast feeds in a cloud environment, and AWS CloudFormation for the ability to easily create and manage AWS assets. The session also covers the importance of redundancy (not just operationally, but for SEC compliance reasons as well) and how financial services organizations can increase geographical diversification of their primary and disaster recovery data centers. We dive deep into each major component of the solution.</p>

<p class='d'>You can now execute Lambda’s almost anywhere – originating in the cloud, and on connected devices with AWS Greengrass. This advanced technical session explores Lambda Functions and what it means to use them across these diverse environments. We will treat the cloud as the ‘brain’, using local Lambda’s for local executions. This way devices can react instinctively, much like the autonomic nervous system, operating in the periphery and responsible for collecting and filtering information, implementing simple and time-sensitive local actions reflexively.</p>

</p><p class='s'>Apaar Sadhwani - Researcher, Stanford &amp; Jason Su - Research Assistant, Stanford University</p>
<p class='d'>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness for people aged 20 to 64, and afflicts more than 120 million people worldwide. Fortunately, vigilant monitoring greatly improves the chance to preserve one’s eyesight. This work used deep learning to analyze images of the retina and fundus for automated diagnosis of DR on a grading scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). We achieved substantial improvement in accuracy compared to traditional approaches and continued advances by using a small auxiliary dataset that provided low-effort, high-value supervision. Data for training and testing, provided by the 2015 Kaggle Data Science Competition with over 80,000 high resolution images (>4 megapixels), required Amazon EC2 scalability to provide the GPU hardware needed to train a convolutional network with over 2 million parameters. For the competition, we focused on accurately modeling the scoring system, penalizing bad mistakes more severely, and combatting the over-prevalence of grade-0 examples in the dataset. We explored ideas first at low resolution on low-cost single-GPU instances. After finding the best methodology, we showed it could be scaled to equivalent improvements at high resolution, using the more expensive quad-GPU instances more effectively. This prototype model placed 15 out of 650 teams across the world with a kappa score of 0.78. We’ve now advanced the model via a new architecture that integrates the prototype and a new network specialized in finding dot hemorrhages, critical to identifying early DR. By annotating a small set of 200 images for hemorrhages, the performance jumped to a kappa of 0.82. We believe strategies that employ a bit more supervision for more effective learning are pivotal for cracking deep learning’s greatest weakness: its voracious appetite for data.</p>

</p><p class='s'>Usman Shakeel - Principal Solution Architect, AWS &amp; Michael Koetter - SVP-Media Technology and Development, Turner Broadcasting</p>
<p class='d'>As Turner continues to make the transition from a traditional broadcast organization to a consumer-centric, data-driven media company, we are being challenged to re-think our approach to content supply. There is a need to achieve new levels of agility, flexibility and scalability to meet the rapidly evolving demands of our top media brands - including TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim and CNN. To that end, we are transitioning the infrastructure that acquires, processes and distributes media for consumer-facing systems to the cloud. At the core of this environment is our Supply Chain Management application. The SCM app provides business and technical process management via an HTML based UI framework, State Machine, Rules Engine, Cost Model, Forms Service. We took advantage of several AWS specific services, including Lambda, S3, Dynamo DB, SNS, Elastic, Cloud Formation and Code Commit. The entire system is instance-less with all application code running in either the browser or within Lambda's. To ease development and debugging we created a method to run all JS libraries in the browser, switching to Lambda when we deploy with Code Commit. Cloud media processing infrastructure is BEING created on demand via an integration with SDVI. The SDVI and SCM apps exchange events and data via SNS and S3.</p>

<p class='d'>Media delivery requirements are continually changing, driven by accelerating mobile, tablet, smart TV, and set-top technology advances. Broadcasters need agile solutions to the changing media and entertainment landscape that don't require multiyear projects with large upfront investments. In this session, we walk through Discovery Communications' migration of its broadcast playout and channel origination to AWS. Discovery Communications is a leader in nonfiction media, reaching more than 3 billion cumulative viewers in 220 countries and territories. Traditionally, broadcast origination for content delivered to telecommunications companies, cable TV, and satellite has existed only in on-premises data centers. In this session, we walk through Discovery's migration of broadcast playout supporting hundreds of channels worldwide to AWS. We show how Discovery has not only reduced their TCO but also has improved their agility by launching new channels on demand. We also walk through how channel origination is being deployed in a secure, automated fashion, and with a level of high availability that exceeds what is possible in a traditional data center.</p>

<p class='d'>As GoPro expands into content networks and launches new products, new challenges have appeared. One of the most critical challenges facing GoPro during this period of rapid growth is their ability to make effective use of massive amounts of data. Every day, GoPro collects increasing amounts of data generated by internet connected consumer devices (smart cameras, smart drones), GoPro mobile apps, GoPro content networks, GoPro e-commerce sales, and social media. This data ranges from raw camera logs to refined and well-structured e-commerce datasets. In the past, it took GoPro months to understand new inbound data and determine how to transform or augment it for analysis. To streamline this process and bridge the gap between tech-savvy engineers and data-savvy analysts, GoPro is creating an analysis loop, which informs product usage trends and product insights. This analysis loop serves a large ecosystem of GoPro executives, product managers, engineers, data scientists, and business analysts through an integrated technology pipeline consisting of Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, Cloudera’s distribution of Hadoop, and Tableau’s Data Visualization Software as the end user analytical tool.

Given our scale, uptime requirements, and the decentralized nature of how we manage our production environment, the VPC migration (still ongoing) presented particular challenges for us and for AWS as it sought to support our move. In this talk, we discuss the starting state, our requirements and the operating principles we developed for how we wanted to drive the migration, some of the issues we ran into, and how the tight partnership with AWS helped us migrate from an EC2-Classic platform to an EC2-VPC platform.</p>

<p class='d'>GxP is an acronym that refers to the regulations and guidelines applicable to life sciences organizations that make food and medical products such as drugs, medical devices, and medical software applications. The overall intent of GxP requirements is to ensure that food and medical products are safe for consumers and to ensure the integrity of data used to make product-related safety decisions.

The term GxP encompasses a broad range of compliance-related activities such as Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and others, each of which has product-specific requirements that life sciences organizations must implement based on the 1) type of products they make and 2) country in which their products are sold. When life sciences organizations use computerized systems to perform certain GxP activities, they must ensure that the computerized GxP system is developed, validated, and operated appropriately for the intended use of the system.

For this session, co-presented with Merck, services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, AWS CloudTrail, AWS CodeCommit, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and AWS CodePipeline will be discussed with an emphasis on implementing GxP-compliant systems in the AWS Cloud.</p>

Based on the nature of vulnerabilities, internal processes, compliance regimes, and other priorities, this session discusses the service to use when. We also show how to detect, report, and fix vulnerabilities, or gain more information about attackers. We dive deep into new features and capabilities of relevant services and use an example from an AWS customer, Siemens AG, about how to best automate governance and scale. A prerequisite for this session is knowledge of security and basic software development using Java, Python, or Node.</p>

<p class='d'>Customers using Amazon S3 at large scale benefit greatly from storage management features. Storage lifecycle policies help them reduce storage costs. Cross-region replication makes it easier to copy data between AWS regions for compliance or disaster recovery. Event notifications allow automatic initiation of processes on objects as they arrive, or capture information about objects and log it for security purposes. In this session, you'll learn about these features, and also several new storage management features in Amazon S3 that give users unmatched visibility into what data they are storing and how that data is being used. These new features make it simpler to analyze usage by users, apps, or organizations, to highlight anomalies, and to optimize business process workflows. They also help identify opportunities to reduce costs, improve performance, and archive infrequently used data. In addition, they can provide insight into who is accessing data stored in S3. As part of this talk, AWS customer Pinterest shows how they have been able to leverage many of the new S3 storage management features to reduce their storage costs significantly by moving a large amount of their data from S3 Standard to S3 Standard – Infrequent Access storage.</p>

<p class='d'>These days, EVERY workload is considered critical by someone in the organization. As a result, SLAs are shrinking. IT is challenged to meet these SLAs, but there isn’t enough budget to provide services like disaster recovery (DR) using traditional methods and infrastructure. The good news is that public cloud platforms, like AWS, are becoming the de facto infrastructure choice for DR. However, workload portability solutions that simplify cross-platform or cloud recovery are required to meet most RTO &amp; RPO SLAs in the cloud. AWS provides the infrastructure we need to bring DR to tier 2 and tier 3 workloads that have never been able to afford it before. Now, we need orchestration and automation to make it scalable and reliable.</p>

</p><p class='s'>Zoltan Nagy - Infrastructure Tech-Stack Owner, Prezi &amp; Tamas Nemeth - Data Platform Tech Lead, Prezi</p>
<p class='d'>Prezi has over 75 million registered users generating 900 GB of new data each day. They store XML describing over 260 million public presentations that have been viewed over 2 billion times. This created a scale problem that on-premises storage couldn't solve. In this session, you'll learn how Prezi leveraged the power and flexibility of Amazon S3 to turn their storage problem into an analytics opportunity and scale storage to meet the demands of their business without overspending. Prezi provides insight on how a small team of engineers accepted the challenge and succeeded using AWS with managed Hadoop (Amazon EMR) and Amazon Redshift. You'll see how Prezi runs and improves its data platform in a self-service data culture with this small team, without drowning in maintenance and support. Additionally, Prezi shows how the infrastructure team architected their services for storing and serving crucial data, user-generated and otherwise, using S3 and Amazon CloudFront—including pitfalls, best practices, cost considerations, and learnings along the way.</p>

<p class='d'>FINRA partnered with AWS product teams to leverage Amazon EMR and Amazon S3 extensively to build an advanced analytics solution. In this session, you'll hear how FINRA implemented a data lake on S3 to provide a single source for their big data analytics platform. FINRA ingests 75 billion records each day of stock market transactions, with an AWS storage footprint of 20 petabytes across S3 and Amazon Glacier. To deal with this workload, FINRA has architected a platform that separates storage from compute to manage capacity for each independently, leading to improved performance and cost effectiveness. You'll also learn how FINRA was able to leverage Hbase on Amazon EMR to achieve significant benefits over running Hbase on a fixed capacity cluster. FINRA was able to implement a system that seamlessly scales in response to data growth and can scale quickly in response to user traffic. By working with multiple clusters, FINRA can now isolate ETL and user query workloads and has achieved rapid, built-in disaster recovery capability by leveraging data storage on S3 to run from multiple AZs and across regions.</p>

<p class='d'>Video is a 'last-mile problem' for search technology. Unlike webpages, documents, and email, content in videos has traditionally been impossible to search. Recent advances in automated speech and text recognition, however, let businesses and universities search inside video assets as easily as inside textual content. In this session, you'll learn how Panopto is using AWS to solve the video-search problem at scale, while saving over 50% in operating costs by taking advantage of Spot instances. We discuss the cross-platform architecture that combines Windows and Linux to provide cost-effective video processing and search indexing. We also dive deep into scaling Spot elastically based on user demand, handling fallback situations when instances are revoked, and using the Spot bidding process to optimize cost structure. Finally, we discuss future plans to reduce operating costs even further through Spot fleets and grid processing.</p>

<p class='d'>In this session, learn how Data Polygamy, a scalable topology-based framework, can enable users to query for statistically significant relationships between spatio-temporal datasets. With the increasing ability to collect data from urban environments and a push toward openness by governments, we can analyze numerous spatio-temporal datasets covering diverse aspects of a city. Urban data captures the behavior of the city’s citizens, existing infrastructure (physical and policies), and environment over space and time. Discovering relationships between these datasets can produce new insights by enabling domain experts to not only test but also generate hypotheses. However, discovery is difficult. A relationship between two datasets can occur only at locations or time periods that behave differently compared to the regions’ neighborhood. The size and number of datasets and diverse spatial and temporal scales at which the data is available presents computational challenges. Finally, of several thousand possible relationships, only a small fraction is actually informative. We have implemented the framework on Amazon EMR and show through an experimental evaluation using over 300 spatial-temporal urban datasets how our approach is scalable and effective at identifying significant relationships.
