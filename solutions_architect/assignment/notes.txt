"VPC with public and private subnets (NAT)"
-------------------------------------------
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html

We recommend this scenario if you want to run a public-facing web application, while maintaining back-end servers that aren't publicly accessible. A common example is a multi-tier website, with the web servers in a public subnet and the database servers in a private subnet.
