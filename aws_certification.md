* Amazon EC2 *instance types* (5):
  * General purpose
  * Compute optimized
  * Memory optimized
  * Accelerated computing
  * Storage optimized 
* Amazon EC2 *pricing*
  * On-Demand _...for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted..._
  * Savings Plan _...commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or 3 year term...._ 
  * Reserved Instances _...assigned to a specific Availability Zone, they provide a capacity reservation..._
  * Spot instances _...spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity; AWS can re-claim any time; 2 minute warning..._
  * Dedicated Hosts 
* Amazon EC2 *Auto Scaling* (2)
  * dynamic scaling - _responds to changing demand_
  * predictive scaling - _automatically schedules...based on predicted demand_ 
* Elastic *Load Balancing* (ELB) - _Regional_ level

  
*Note:* ...primary difference between the two programs is that Reserved Instances offer a discount against On-Demand pricing depending on committed utilization, whereas Savings Plans offer a discount depending on committed spend....
