</p>
<p class='d'>Successful machine learning models are built on high-quality training datasets. Labeling raw data to get accurate training datasets involves a lot of time and effort because sophisticated models can require thousands of labeled examples to learn from, before they can produce good results. Typically, the task of labeling is distributed across a large number of humans, adding significant overhead and cost. Join us as we introduce Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth, a new service that provides an effective solution to reduce this cost and complexity using a machine learning technique called active learning. Active learning reduces the time and manual effort required to do data labeling, by continuously training machine learning algorithms based on labels from humans. By iterating through ambiguous data points, Ground Truth improves the ability to automatically label data resulting in high-quality training datasets.</p>

<p class='d'>Logged user interactions are one of the most ubiquitous forms of data available because they can be recorded from a variety of systems (e.g., search engines, recommender systems, ad placement) at little cost. Naively using this data, however, is prone to failure. A key problem lies in biases that systems inject into the logs by influencing where we will receive feedback (e.g., more clicks at the top of the search ranking). This talk explores how counterfactual inference techniques can make learning algorithms robust against bias. This makes log data accessible to a broad range of learning algorithms, from ranking SVMs to deep networks.</p>

<p class='d'>As more customers adopt Amazon VPC architectures, the features and flexibility of the service are encountering the obstacles of evolving design requirements. In this session, we follow the evolution of a single regional VPC to a multi-VPC, multi-region design with diverse connectivity into on-premises systems and infrastructure. Along the way, we investigate creative customer solutions for scaling and securing outbound VPC traffic, securing private access to Amazon S3, managing multi-tenant VPCs, integrating existing customer networks through AWS Direct Connect, and building a full VPC mesh network across global regions. Please join us for a speaker meet-and-greet following this session at the Speaker Lounge (ARIA East, Level 1, Willow Lounge).

<p class='d'>The emergence of serverless infrastructure and services represents a fundamental shift in how developers approach architecting applications. This is especially relevant in the world of SaaS where systems must efficiently and cost-effectively respond to continually shifting multi-tenant loads and profiles. We'll conduct an end-to-end review of all the elements of a serverless SaaS architecture that leverages a combination of AWS Lambda, Fargate, and Aurora Serverless. We'll look at how serverless influence the core elements of your architecture, including tenant isolation, service decomposition, management and monitoring, deployment, and identity.

We have a deep understanding of system availability, informed by over a decade of experience operating the cloud and our roots of operating Amazon.com for nearly a quarter-century. One thing we've learned is that failures come in many forms, some expected, and some unexpected. It's vital to build from the ground up and embrace failure. A core consideration is how to minimize the "blast radius" of any failures. In this talk, we discuss a range of blast radius reduction design techniques that we employ, including cell-based architecture, shuffle-sharding, availability zone independence, and region isolation. We also discuss how blast radius reduction infuses our operational practices.</p>

<p class='d'>Although the AWS Cloud provides a new level of durability and resiliency, no workload is immune to disasters-be it due to accidental reasons or malicious intent. Even in the cloud, you have to ensure continuity. Traditional disaster recovery (DR) solutions are not optimized for the cloud and often result in higher costs, increased complexity, and operational challenges. To maintain compliance and business continuity service-level agreements, AWS DR planning requires a completely different approach to deal with cross-account, cross-region workload testing and failover. In this session, learn how you can set up an effective DR plan for your AWS environments. This session is brought to you by AWS partner, Druva.</p>

<p class='d'>Kubernetes is taking off and being rapidly adopted both on-premises and in the AWS Cloud. Today, enterprises are struggling to build, deploy, and manage production-ready environments at scale. The Cisco Hybrid Solution for Kubernetes on AWS makes it easy for customers to run production-grade Kubernetes on-premises. This is achieved by configuring on-premises Kubernetes environments to be consistent with Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) and by combining Cisco's networking, security, management, and monitoring software with the world-class cloud services of AWS. This enables customers to focus on building and using applications instead of being constrained by where they run.</p>

<p class='d'>At technical community gatherings, Meetups, or events, the majority of attendees and speakers tend to be men. Women often feel uncomfortable attending such events, leading women in technology to start technical communities for only for women. Although the purpose of these women-in-tech communities is to help more women feel welcomed and create equality between men and women in the industry, these communities might be inadvertently doing the exact opposite. In this talk, we share perspectives on gender diversity in technology, and we discuss the value of participating in mixed-gender Meetups. We also share insights from AWS user communities worldwide, and we discuss steps we take to make our AWS community in Israel-one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 members-more inclusive.

When building a fraud detection system, start by preparing the data, and work with small chunks of data and run parallel jobs so your machine learning (ML) models can predict fraudulent activity. For that, you schedule computer resources and, of course, the script. With AWS Batch, you only worry about your application job and run it at scale. With containers, you think in small processes and let AWS Batch run them concurrently. In this session, learn to build a fraud detection system and integrate it with other AWS services.

<p class='d'>DevOps is a powerful movement that can help enterprises speed up their rate of innovation. But many large organizations struggle to implement DevOps at scale due to conflicts (real and perceived) with existing IT processes. Enterprise DevOps is the convergence of the speed and agility from modern development processes with the governance, security, and compliance control from traditional IT operations processes. In this session, learn how to implement enterprise DevOps in your organization through building a culture of inclusion, common sense, and continuous improvement. Also learn how to incorporate the knowledge from subject matter experts across your business into your automated DevOps guardrails to create the positive feedback loop we call "patterns of efficiency."

Join Tim Bray, Senior Principal Engineer, to hear about the high-level choices that developers at AWS and our customers have to make. Here are a few: Are microservices always the way to go? Serverless, containers, or serverless containers? Is relational over? Is Java over? The talk is technical and based on our experience in building AWS services and working with customers on their cloud-native apps.</p>

<p class='d'>Real-time analytics has traditionally been analyzed using batch processing in DWH/Hadoop environments. Common use cases use data lakes, data science, and machine learning (ML). Creating serverless data-driven architecture and serverless streaming solutions with services like Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Athena can solve real-time ingestion, storage, and analytics challenges, and help you focus on application logic without managing infrastructure. In this session, we introduce design patterns, best practices, and share customer journeys from batch to real-time insights in building modern serverless data-driven architecture applications. Hear how Intel built the Intel Pharma Analytics Platform using a serverless architecture. This AI cloud-based offering enables remote monitoring of patients using an array of sensors, wearable devices, and ML algorithms to objectively quantify the impact of interventions and power clinical studies in various therapeutics conditions.</p>
